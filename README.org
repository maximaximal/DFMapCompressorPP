* DFMapCompressPP

This is the spiritual successor to [[https://github.com/Ramblurr/df-map-compressor][Shadowlord13's map compressor]]. It is written
in C++ and aims to implement some core functionality as efficient and portable
as possible and to make Dwarf Fortress map sharing more accessible to everyone.

to find some detailed tile, which it then matches.
